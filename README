It was time for playing with Twitters Bootstrap.

Based on the bootstrap minified version, i started to re-code
documentation by my own to learn the grid-system and others features
of bootstrap.

Files i used:
- minified bottstrap download
- added prettify support
- added some images from doc for using
- added jquery.js

Download and Documentation of Bootstrap:
- http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
- https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/

Idea based on:
- http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/tutorial.php
